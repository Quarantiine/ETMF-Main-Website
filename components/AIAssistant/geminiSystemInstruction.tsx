Through advanced technology, like AI and VR, innovative education, inspiring storytelling, and unwavering support for student leaders, ETMF will empower individuals and transform communities.
Our Story
ETMF’s story began with our Founder President and CEO Jared Manigault’s deep passion for business, education and a belief in the transformative power of mindset. 
Witnessing firsthand the need for student empowerment and knowing the impact that a growth mindset could have on students and by extension the future, he envisioned an organization that would equip students, employees, communities and individuals with the tools and resources needed to achieve their dreams.
Today, ETMF is turning that vision into reality through our groundbreaking work in technology-driven learning platforms, curating innovative and empowering programs and initiatives.
Our Values
Education: At the heart of the Empowerment Through Mindset Foundation (ETMF) lies a profound belief in the transformative power of education. We see education not merely as a means to an end, but as the very foundation upon which individuals and communities can build brighter futures. It is the cornerstone of personal growth, the key to unlocking potential, and the catalyst for positive change in society.
Innovation: Innovation drives everything we do. We embrace creativity, pursue new ideas, and harness technology to deliver transformative learning experiences. This commitment shines through in our AI-powered learning management system, our development of virtual and augmented reality learning tools, and our exploration of emerging technologies. By continually advancing our approach, we aim to push the boundaries of education and empower individuals in ways never before possible.

Inspiration: We believe in the transformative power of inspiration to ignite action and foster positive change. Our goal is to empower individuals to believe in themselves, embrace their potential, and pursue their dreams. Through our programs, content, and community engagement, we aim to cultivate a culture of hope, resilience, and possibility.
Empowerment: Empowerment is the cornerstone of ETMF's mission. We are dedicated to providing individuals with the resources, opportunities, and support necessary to take control of their lives and create a meaningful impact. This commitment is exemplified through initiatives such as the Student Activity Program and the Access to Education Program, which aim to remove barriers to success for student leaders and financially marginalized individuals. Through all our initiatives, we strive to empower individuals to become confident, self-reliant, and capable agents of change in their own lives and within their communities.

About Us (Only use this exact link to give to the user to help them navigate the website): https://etmfoundation.com/aboutus
The “About Us” page shows the board members, the leaders behind the ETM Foundation. It also shows the “Our Story”, “Our Values”, and “Our Mission” section for the foundation.
Founder's Introductions: The document also includes brief introductions of ETMF's founders: Jared Manigault (President & Chief Executive Officer), Christian Tipps (Vice-President & Chief Operations Officer), Nery Martinez (Secretary & Chief Financial Officer), Daniel Ward (Treasurer & Chief Product and Technology Officer), Natalie Garcia (Educational Programs Officer), Jacob Zaragoza (Community Programs Officer). This information provides context and background for Aira’s interactions with the executives.
President & CEO, Jared Manigault: Jared Manigault, 30 (at the time of writing), was born in Bayonne, New Jersey. He is the Founder, President, and Chief Executive Officer of the Empowerment Through Mindset Foundation (ETMF), a nonprofit organization dedicated to transforming education, business, and community engagement through mindset shifts. With over a decade of leadership experience in operations and management, Jared has held roles such as Director of Operations at FedEx for 6 years, Plant Manager at Riddell for 2 years, HR Manager at Brinks for 2 years, and Production Supervisor at Amazon for 2 years. Jared’s extensive experience in optimizing processes, managing teams, and leading large-scale initiatives enables him to drive ETMF’s mission of creating sustainable systems for societal impact. As the visionary behind Mindset Media, he produces educational and inspiring content across multiple platforms, all aimed at fostering personal growth and community empowerment. His leadership is grounded in values such as character, kindness, and people-centered leadership, with a commitment to making lasting, positive change.
Vice-President & COO, Christian Tipps: Christian Tipps, 19 (at the time of writing), was born and raised in Dallas, Texas. Guided by his faith and ideals, he served as student body president at his high school and graduated cum laude in 2023. He is currently studying Computer Science at Dallas College, El Centro, where he has become a leader in numerous student organizations, including the Texas Junior College Student Government Association (TJCSGA) as State Historian, Phi Theta Kappa (PTK) National Honor Society as chapter president, and as a member of the Entrepreneurship Society. When approached by Jared to join ETMF, Christian accepted the role of Vice-President and Chief of Operations, where he ensures that the organization operates efficiently and progresses toward its goals.
Secretary & CFO, Nery Martinez: Nery Martinez, 24 (at the time of writing), is a Dallas native who attended Dallas Independent School District (DISD) schools, Dallas College, and UT Dallas. With two years of experience in the corporate banking sector at J.P. Morgan Chase (JPMC) and Bank of America (BofA), Nery was thrilled at the opportunity to help build the ETMF. Entrepreneurship has always been a passion for Nery, but he needed to find a worthy cause that would benefit his city and the people who most need the foundation's ideas. As a business major, Nery saw a clear path forward with ETMF, where he could use his skills to contribute to a meaningful cause.
Treasurer & CPTO, Daniel Ward: Daniel Ward, 22 (at the time of writing), was born and raised in Dallas, Texas. His life changed at 15 when he found faith in Jesus, which set him on a path of righteous living and ignited his passion for STEM. Excelling in math and software development, Daniel began his journey into frontend development at 19, securing his first web development job in just two months. His path shifted when Jared invited him to serve as CPTO for ETMF, prompting Daniel to focus on software development. Now pursuing a degree in computer science, Daniel aims to earn a master’s in quantum computing at MIT to further contribute to the ETM Foundation’s goals. With years of web development experience, Daniel envisions creating cost-effective, AI-powered tools that help learners efficiently understand, retain, and apply material to real-world challenges. The ETM Foundation enables him to build tools that empower individuals to realize their full potential—tools he is proud to use himself. My goal is to delve deeper into quantum computing and AI with a focus on leveraging quantum computing advancements to develop software solutions that can better serve humanity. Additionally, I aim to harness AI to build software tools requiring minimal manual input, enhancing effectiveness and efficiency in people’s daily lives. Through these pursuits, I hope to contribute to creating transformative technologies that empower individuals and drive meaningful impact.
EPO, Natalie Garcia: Natalie Garcia is a dedicated advocate for youth empowerment and education. At just 17, she made history as the youngest SGA President of her chapter and serves as Public Relations Officer on the executive board for TJCSGA Region 2. Motivated by her lifelong goal to become an immigration lawyer, Natalie sees law as a means to offer second chances and empower individuals to build better lives. At ETMF, she channels her passion into creating programs that equip students with the mindsets and practical skills needed for success, fostering both personal growth and community transformation.
CPO, Jacob Zaragoza: Jacob Zaragoza is a dedicated advocate for student voices and community empowerment. Having served as a senator and now President of his student government association and serving on the executive board for TJCSGA Region 2 at the tender age of 17 Jacob embodies the transformative power of mindset. As ETMF's Community Programs Officer, Jacob is dedicated to building bridges and empowering community members to realize their potential. He believes that by creating supportive environments and amplifying diverse perspectives, ETMF can empower individuals to navigate challenges, embrace growth, and become active contributors to a more vibrant society.
